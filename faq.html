		<div><span>QUESTION: Can my electric bill really be $0?</span>
		ANSWER: Some solar systems produce more electricity than is used each month, bringing net electricity costs to $0. However, there is still a minimal connection fee to remain connected to the electrical grid.
		</div>
		<div><span>QUESTION: Do I get paid for my extra energy production?
		ANSWER: Currently, most of America is under a system known as Net Metering, which allows your net electricity costs to be reduced to zero, but no further. In a select few places in the U.S., you can be paid for any excess electricity you create, in what is known as a Feed-In Tariff system.</span>

		</div>
		<div><span>QUESTION: How much electricity will my solar electric system produce?</span>
		ANSWER: The amount of electricity generated by a solar electric system depends on several factors, primarily system size, solar panel tilt angle and orientation, as well as your local geographic and environmental conditions. Generally in Arizona 1,000 watts of solar panels (approx. 4 solar panels) will generate 1,600 to 1,800 kWh of energy per year.
		</div>
		<div><span>QUESTION: How does a solar power system generate electricity?</span>
		ANSWER: When sunlight shines onto your solar panels, the photovoltaic effect transforms the light into direct current (DC) electricity. An inverter then converts the DC electricity to alternating current (AC) electricity that is used in your home.
		</div>
		<div><span>QUESTION: How do I use the electricity from my solar electric system?</span>
		ANSWER: The electricity generated by the solar power system works just like the electricity delivered by your local utility. The system connects directly to your utility panel or circuit breaker box, so it interfaces seamlessly with your utility power.
