	<h1>No surprises. No rate hikes. No kidding.
	You know when you open your utility bill and gasp because your electric rates suddenly went up?
	</h1>
	<h2>That won’t happen anymore. We offer a guaranteed rate - and even better? We lock in those rates for 25 years. The catch? Well, there is no catch. Really. Here’s all there is to it.
	</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>We buy the system and install it on your roof.</li>
		<li>You pay a low monthly fee for your electricity.</li>
		<li>It generates power for you – with rates that are locked in.</li>
		<li>If you move? We’ll even help transfer the service to the new buyer.</li>
		<li>Did we mention that rates are locked in?</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>How much can you save?</h1>
	<h2>You save when you pay a rate for electricity lower than what you pay to your utility. Every time your utility raises rates, your solar rates will still be locked in.
	How much you'll save will be specific to you. If utility rates continue to increase as they have historically, the average Solar customer is expected to save thousands on electricity bills over the life of the Plan. The best way to find out how much you'll save is a quick phone call.
