		<h1>Tap Into The Sun - How Much Can You Save?</h1>
		<h2>Find out now before The Federal Tax Credits Run Out!</h2>

			<p>
				Boasting the most sun of any state, Arizona lends itself to solar power. Add to that high power bills, and established solar rebate programs, and it just makes sense to get solar on your home here.

				Photovoltaic solar modules are the most commonly recognized solar product in the world today.  These systems actually convert the sun's energy into electricity and can greatly reduce your montly power bill.  Homeowners using photovoltaic systems will enjoy freedom from higher electricity bills and the comfort of knowing that they are helping the planet and making the country more secure. Cash flow produced by an investment in a home photovoltaic system is equal if not better than many other traditional investments and we can prove it! Photovoltaic systems qualify for a 30% Federal Tax Rebate and several local utilities have incentive programs for photovoltaic systems.

			<h1>Arizona Net Metering</h1>
			
			<p>	After months of workshops, regulatory filings and a media battle, on November 14, the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) made an important decision regarding net metering. While APS’s original proposal of a $50-$100 monthly charge was rejected, the ACC did approve a $0.70/kW monthly charge for new residential solar customer (a $3.50 monthly charge for a 5 kW system). While SEIA is concerned with imposing an interim charge outside of a rate case, the decision also confirms that the general rate case in 2015 is the appropriate venue for such discussions.

			<h1>Plug-in to savings</h1>
			
			<p>	While Solar Electric might not be a fix-all solution, it may help lower electricity costs because it has guaranteed production. Let’s take a regular electrical outlet to use as an example. If the top outlet receptacle were to cost you $1 to use and the cost can increase, and the bottom receptacle only costs $.75 cents and will ultimately decrease, which would you prefer to plug into?

			The utility companies may have increased rates during the daytime, which obviously is the time we would naturally use more electricity. A Solar Electric System (depending on size) will take care of your daytime usage, offsetting typically higher rates. What’s the most logical decision for you and your future?

			Plug-in to savings! Make the change to solar today!
